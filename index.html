<h2>Base structure</h2>
<p><code>/execute</code> is a command that runs another command, but with modifiers. The base structure of new <code>/execute</code> is as follows:</p>

    execute <subcommands> run <command>

<ul>
	<li>Between <code>execute</code> and <code>run</code> go the modifiers, which will be referred to as <i>subcommands</i>.</li>
	<li>After the word <code>run</code> goes the command to run, hereafter referred to as the <i>command</i>.
</ul>

## Old MCBE `/execute` to new `/execute` ##

Old MCBE `/execute` is simply the same as new `/execute`, but with *fixed* subcommands.
That is, you do not get to choose which subcommands to apply, you must only use the subcommands in a certain order.

Every old `/execute` command can be turned into a new `/execute` command like so:

    execute @e[tag=test] ~12 ~23 ~34 summon lightning_bolt
    
    execute as @e[tag=test] at @s positioned ~12 ~23 ~34 run summon lightning_bolt
<!---->
    execute @e[tag=test] ~12 ~23 ~34 detect ~ ~-1 ~ stone 0 summon lightning_bolt
    
    execute as @e[tag=test] at @s positioned ~12 ~23 ~34 if block ~ ~-1 ~ stone 0 run summon lightning_bolt

Or, in general form,

    execute <entity> <coords> run <command>
    
    execute as <entity> at @s positioned <coords> run <command>
<!---->
    execute <entity> <coords> detect <coords> <block> <data> <command>
    
    execute as <entity> at @s positioned <coords> if block <coords> <block> <data> run <command>
    
With new `/execute`, you are no longer restricted to these two variants presented above.
You can choose any number of subcommands, in any order, to modify the way the command is run.

So, let's look at some subcommands:

## Subcommands ##
Subcommands present in both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Subcommand</th>
      <th>Syntax</th>
      <th>Layman's terms</th>
      <th>Technical terms</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th><code>as</code></th>
      <td><pre>execute as &lt;entity&gt;<br>execute as @e[tag=test]</pre></td>
      <td>Change <em>who</em> executes the command.</td>
      <td>Change the command <em>executor</em> to the specified entity(ies).</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>This changes</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
	</table>
